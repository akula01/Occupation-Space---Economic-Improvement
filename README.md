# Occupation-Space-Economic-Improvement

Relationships between highly-related occupations take on a higher value while those that are less closely related take a lower value. Occupational data for nine US regions are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and ONET database, an online data cache of occupational information supported by the US Department of Labor. 

The density of relationships among occupations in three different service sectors is shown below.
